# 🥡🤖 Folia To Go

This repo has automated, nightly builds of the [Folia](https://github.com/PaperMC/Folia) server for Minecraft so that you don't have to build it yourself. 

Every midnight UTC, GitHub Actions runs [the build script](https://github.com/CubeBeveled/CoreProtectToGoblob/main/build.sh) and uploads the plugin .jar to the [Actions](https://github.com/CubeBeveled/CoreProtectToGoactions) area.

These builds may or may not be up-to-date with the latest CoreProtect commits because they run at a certain time every day.
